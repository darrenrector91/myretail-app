## Base Functionality
- [x] Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON.
- [x] Performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the product name from an external API
- [x] Reads pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the product id and name from the HTTP request into a single response

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Accepts an HTTP PUT request at the same path (/products/{id}), containing a JSON request body similar to the GET response, and updates the productâ€™s price in the data store
